**Ideas for domain-specific modules:** geospatial (?), genomes (many), functional genomics (many), images (Sherwood), ecology (Kerr), behavior (Alberts), population genetics (Willis), quantitative genetics (?), phylogenetics (Lutzoni)  
**Ideas for faculty lunch speakers:** Gibert, Donohue, Schmid, D Sherwood, Baugh, Volkan, Wright, Yoder (want a mix of topics and approaches; should be cheerful interlocutors; aim for 4 per semester?)  
**Ideas for trainee lunch speakers:** we will need about 8 per semester; a mix of more senior grad students and postdocs; could potentially draw speakers from other programs and departments
